1) A geostationary satellite is located 90ºW. Calculate the azimuth angle for an Earth station antenna located at latitude 35ºW and longitude 100ºW
2) An FSS ground terminal located in Chicago, IL, at latitude 41.5◦ N and longitude 87.6◦W has access to two GSO satellites, one stationed at 70◦W longitude and the second at 135◦W longitude. Which satellite will provide the more reliable link (higher elevation angle) for the ground terminal? The ground terminal elevation above sea level is 0.5 km. Assume 0◦ inclination angle for the satellites.
3) What are the minimum and maximum round trip signal propagation times to a satellite in geostationary orbit, for an allowable elevation angle range of 90◦ to 0◦? Assume an inclination angle of 0◦.
4) Which type of satellite orbit provides the best performance for a communications network for each of the following criteria: (a) Minimum free space path loss (b) Best coverage of high latitude locations (c) Full global coverage for a mobile communications network (d) Minimum latency (time delay) for voice and data networks (e) Ground terminals with little or no antenna tracking required

5) What factors determine the number of satellites required for a network of NGSO satellites serving a global distribution of mobile earth terminals? Include considerations of frequency of operation, pointing, and tracking as well as adequate coverage.

6) A LEO satellite is in a circular orbit 322 km above the earth. Assume the average radius of the earth is 6378 km. Assume the earth eccentricity is 0. a) Determine the orbital velocity of the satellite in m/sec b) What is the orbital period, in minutes, for the LEO satellite? c) From the above, determine the orbital angular velocity for the satellite, in radians/sec.

A communication satellite is basically an electronic communication package placed in orbit whose prime objective is to initiate or assist communication transmission of information or message from one point to another through space

 The satellite is an active transmission relay, similar in function to relay towers used in terrestrial microwave communications

 The information transferred most often corresponds to voice (telephone), video (television), and digital data
Satellites are specifically made for telecommunication purpose. They are used for mobile applications such as communication to ships, vehicles, planes, hand-held terminals and for TV and radio broadcasting

 They are responsible for providing these services to an assigned region (area) on the earth

 The power and bandwidth of these satellites depend upon the preferred size of the footprint (a certain area on the earth covered by a satellite), complexity of the traffic control protocol schemes and the cost of ground stations
